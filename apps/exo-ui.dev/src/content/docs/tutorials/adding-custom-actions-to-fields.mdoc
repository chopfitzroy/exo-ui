description: How to extend existing Exo UI functionality

Sometimes the functions provided by Exo UI simply aren't enough when dealing with complex business logic.

When you want to extend the functions provided by Exo UI we recommend mapping over the data returned from which ever component you are using and adding a new `custom` key to each item.

**Note:** While any string will work we recommend `custom` because we considered that key _reserved_ and will never ship any logic that would intefer with that.
