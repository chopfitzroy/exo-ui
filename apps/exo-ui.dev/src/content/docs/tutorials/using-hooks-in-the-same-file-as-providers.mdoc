title: Using hooks in the same file as providers
description: For when you want to use a hook in the same file as the provider is rendered.

Sometimes you will want to use a hook instead of the `Values` component. This is especially true if you want to massage the data returned from Exo UI before rendering.

Normally this isn't an issue when you have rendered the `Provider` further up the component tree, sometimes however we want to use a hook in the same file we create the Exo UI component.

This is easy enough to do and just requires us to create two components in the file we are working in, below is a working example.

{% editor files=[{ name: "/App.tsx", file: "use-hook-same-file-as-provider.tsx" }] /%}
