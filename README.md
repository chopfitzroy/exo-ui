# Exo UI 💎

> Headless UI components _without_ semantic restrictions.

Exo UI is a _workflow_ component library. It takes a _zero markup_ philosophy meaning that you are entirely responsible for the components look and feel.

It also means that Exo UI can be run with [React](https://react.dev/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) making it highly versitile.

Exo UI does not require [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to be used although they do pair quite nicely 🥂.

### Misc 🔮

Why Exo UI? Inspired by the term _"exoskeleton"_ which comes from Greek έξω éxō _"outer"_ and σκελετός skeletós _"skeleton"_ we think of Exo UI as the _"outer"_ wrapper around your data.
