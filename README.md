# Stiches ðŸ§µ

Stiches is a headless component library. It takes a _zero markup_ philosophy meaning that you are entirely responsible for the components look and feel.

It also means that stiches can be run with [React](https://react.dev/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) making it highly versitile.

Stiches does not require [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to be used although they do pair quite nicely ðŸ¥‚.
